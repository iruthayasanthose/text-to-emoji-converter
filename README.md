## Text To Emoji Converter

You know how sometimes you type English and it has all these letters and words and no emoji? Yeah, emoji-translate fixes that.

The Live version of this [Project](https://iruthayasanthose.github.io/text-to-emoji-converter/) ‚úì

## As a library

You can also use this as a standalone library for your own translation purposes.

### Install

```
npm install moji-translate
```

### Usage

```
translate = require('moji-translate');

console.log(translate.getAllEmojiForWord('üëÄ'));
console.log(translate.translate("the house is on fire and the cat is eating the cake"));

```

The `emoji-translate` api has 5 methods:

- `isMaybeAlreadyAnEmoji` -- returns true if a character is already an emoji
- `getAllEmojiForWord(word)` -- returns a list of possible emoji translations
- `getEmojiForWord(word)` -- returns a random translation from the list
  returned by `getAllEmojiForWord(word)`
- `translate(chunk, onlyEmoji)` -- returns a translation of the whole chunk of text. If `onlyEmoji` is true, then the untranslatable words are removed
- `translateForDisplay` -- calls `translate` but returns a `<span>` element that contains either the original word, or the emoji translation, ready for display (either as a span, or a `<select>` if multiple translations are
  available)

## Chrome extension

There's also a Chrome [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/emoji-translate/kkkfndlpdajmbgofkidemhkjoinhmojl) that lets you translate any page on the internet to emoji. Your nightmares are finally over.
